# #OSC Monitor

A very common problem I had when doing interactive installations, had to do with OSC messages. Debugging OSC was kind of hard, specially when working without a laptop or computer. That's why I decided to design and build an iPhone app that allows me to keep track of the OSC messages.

The interface was designed for a quick usage, filtering OSC messages by its *address* and showing the last values as them updates. Tt has a mode that allows see the history of messages in chronological order, and also has a simple OSC sender, which allows to send different types of values.

It was published in the AppStore in 2015.
