# #OSC Monitor

A very often problem I had when doing interactive installations, had to do with OSC messages. Debugging OSC was kind of hard, specially when working without a laptop or computer. That's why I decided to create an app.

Using a simple interface, allows the user to track values in OSC protocols, as well as sending custom messages to different devices.

I was published in the AppStore in 2015.
