# #Monolith Controversies

![Monolith Controversies intro](images/monolith controversies/thumb.jpg)

I was invited to develop the media installation of the Chilean Pavilion at the 2014 Venice International Architecture Exhibition. I developed a syncronized system with low-cost *Raspberry Pi* to control all the projections and lights in the pavilion, which were decided to be monotone in order to create an atmosphere of dialogue with the work.

This pavilion was recognized by the jury with the Silver Lion.
