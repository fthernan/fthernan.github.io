NOE SCL is an interactive project that shows different types of data of the city of Santiago, Chile, and analyzed that data using a series of algorithms. As part of the team that worked on this project, I was in charge of developing all the visualizations and data analysis.

The project consisted in three visualizations of data in the city: transport, contamination and consumption. There was a fourth visualization that shows a combined analysis of the other 3, with heatmaps and other specific data.

This work was presented in the MAXXI museum, Rome, as part of the *ENERGY* exposition. Data was generously provided by the OCUC (City Observatory - UC, Chile), GEO Research (Chile), and other was obtained directly through the Chile's government website.
