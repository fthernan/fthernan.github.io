# #Augmented Hand

Augmented Hand is a concept, created by me, for an interface to interact with the virtual world using a wearable, similar to a glove. It consist in an small pack of sensors that first of all recognize with which object you want to interact with. After that, you can interact with that object using natural gestures with your hand.

BLA BLA BLA To interact in a natural way with the virtual media.
