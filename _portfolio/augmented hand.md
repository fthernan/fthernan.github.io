# #Augmented Hand

Augmented Hand is an experimental device created to enhance **human-computer interaction**. It consists in a wearable, similar to a glove, with a small pack of sensors -IR and an IMU- that can track the hand gestures and recognize objects when pointing them. After the recognition, it is capable of sending the data thought Wi-Fi to a IoT-enabled device.

It allows independence of screens and VR-kits, providing a much more natural interaction between a human and a device.
