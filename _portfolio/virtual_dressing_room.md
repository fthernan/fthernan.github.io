# #Virtual dressing room

![Image 3](images/virtual dressing room/img03.jpg)

Virtual dressing room was a project I worked for *Falabella*, an important retail store in Chile. It consists in a large TV screen (72") which acts like a mirror using a webcam. When a person stands in front of it, a *Kinect* recognizes the body and invites the person to start using the Virtual dressing room showing a menu with lots of dresses. Using just a hand, the person was able to choose their dresses and the application showed the clothed fitted in the user body.

Also, there was a second screen that showed random recordings of other people that previously used the Virtual dressing room.

As part of the team, I was the only one who programmed and worked with hardware/electronics in this project, so, I was in charge of 3D visualization as well as body recognition and hand/gesture interactivity. Being able to work together with designers and publicists and was key to complete the project in less than 2 months.

This virtual dressing room was used in 3 campaigns in the store.
