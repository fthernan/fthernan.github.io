*Smart solutions for smart results.*

I’m the cofounder of Khapto, a breakthrough instrument that allows physical therapists to improve their understanding and control of their patients, through the measuring, register and tracking the intensity and quality of the therapies they perform over them. All of this with real time information, as an objective way to follow up on the goals and insights of therapy.

It consist on a smart glove with force sensors and an IMU that sends information to a smartphone via Bluetooth in order to see the processed data in real time and inform about the actual state of the patient’s health. With all the data collected, using AI, we are working in a model that will predict which treatment procedure would be more effective, as well as predict recovery times. The system allows the professional to saving time, reducing costs and attend more people.

My main labor on the company has been in charge of the technical area, as a CTO I been developing the technology that allow us to accomplish this huge global mission, to improve people's health. The develop and design of the electronics, testing the sensors, calibrate them, measure their quality and by consequence all the procedures to insurance that the quality of the device are optimal for it's professional use.

Even when I’m technically the CTO it’s well known that at startups, we have to do more labors, so I also collaborate with the textile design and electronic integration, because is essential for the best product design.  

The second most important area on the startup is the software development, my job was principally develop the frontend of the app for android devices, I was part of the UX research, so we interview and live part of the professional daily routine, then apply all the principles of the UI.
and the developing backend, frontend and the UI & UX design of the app in collaboration with the team.
