*Smart solutions for smart results.*

I'm cofounder of Khapto, a revolutionary tool allows physical therapist to measure and register the intensity of the therapies they perform on their patients in real time, as well as a better way to follow up on the objectives and breakthroughs of therapy.

It consist in a smart glove with force sensors and an IMU that sends info to a cellphone in order to see the processed data in real time and inform about the state of the patient's health status.
With all the data collected, using AI, we are working in a model that will predict which treatment procedure would be more effective, as well as predict recovery time and costs.
