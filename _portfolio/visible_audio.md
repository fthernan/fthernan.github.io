*Visible audio* is a personal project developed in order to create an interaction between physical objects and sound. As we know, sound is something that we experiment every day, but we can not see it, and maybe that is the reason of lack of knowledge about it. In this project, using a **FTDT simulation**, I try to show what would it looks like (of course, neglecting time scale constrictions).

Two types of objects were recognized using a **Kinect**: walls and sources. For this project, a cellphone was cataloged as *source* and anything else as *wall*. A microphone is used as audio input for the software, and performing an **FFT**, the magnitude of some of the frequencies were used to create the source. The simulation was later **mapped** in the same objects.
