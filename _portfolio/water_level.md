# #Water level system

I designed and build a remote water level system for irrigation channel. As part of the process, I designed an ultra-sensitive capacitor sensor and build a PCB. Using GMS and a microcontroller, data was sent to a web server in order to visualize it in a website.

This system is working with a solar powered system, and has a battery to operate during the night.
