# #CMN Mobile App

I designed and build a hybrid mobile app for the National Monuments Council (CMN) of Chile in order to register properties and national monuments, with geo-referenced photos and areas. It synchronize the local data with a web server in order to have a global data base.

With a website the admin can view and edit all the registered national monuments, and generate pdf reports as output.

The app was made with Ionic Framework, the website was made with AngularJS, and the server was programmed with PHP and MySQL.
