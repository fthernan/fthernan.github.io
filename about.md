![Me](images/me.jpg){: .right_img}

I am an artist, coder, and physicist who love to understand how things work and deeply study about lots of fields, because I think that's the only way to create new solutions and contribute to the progress of humanity.

I like making things with electronics, computer vision, machine learning and cutting-edge technology, but I'm also a self-taught accordionist and watercolor painter. I am really passionate about mixing arts and science, specially in fields like **data visualization & analysis, human-computer interaction, wearable interfaces and computer vision.**.
