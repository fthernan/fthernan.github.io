![Me](images/me.jpg){: .right_img}

I am a coder and physicist who love to understand how things work and deeply study about lots of fields, because I think that's the only way to create new solutions and contribute to improving people's lives.

I like making things with electronics, computer vision, machine learning and cutting-edge technology, but I'm also a self-taught accordionist and watercolor painter.
<!-- I am really passionate about mixing arts and science, specially in fields like **data visualization & analysis, human-computer interaction, wearable interfaces and computer vision.**. -->

This website is intended to show my works outside of physics (mostly programming and electronics).

You can find my scientific work in my CV, [**here**](https://fthernan.github.com/assets/CV-Francisco_Hernandez.pdf).
